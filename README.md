# Archive of Iranian Armenian
This GitHub repository is a temporary placeholder for our fieldwork recordings on Iranian Armenian. This GitHub repository can be used for finding this repository for the time being. This archive is associated with our grammar on Iranian Armenian (Dolatian et al in review).

The grammar contains details on our glossing, transcriptions, paradigms, and consultants. For the transcriptions in this archive, the only zero morphs that we segment are the auxiliary, the past morphs, and the subjunctive past: [∅-i-m]  is-PST-1SG, ‘I was’, [e-∅-ɻ] is-PST-3SG ‘he was’, [jeɾkʰ-e-∅-ɻ] sing-TH-PST-3SG ‘(If) he sang’, [jeɾkʰ-∅-i-ŋkʰ] sing-TH-PST-1PL ‘(If) we sang’. 
The other zero morphs can be surmised from the translation, such as the imperative, 3SG, connegatives, and perfective. 
 
The archive consists of the following:

1) **[Elicitations](/Elicitations)**: Recordings of word lists and elicited sentences by the consultant. 
2) **[Text](/SampleText)**: Sample text that was used in the grammar. 
3) **[Grammar examples](/GrammarExamples)**: Original audio files for illustrated examples.
4) **[Verb conjugations](/VerbConjugation)**: Paradigms for verb conjugation classes.

## Elicitations
One of the grammar authors remotely recorded a speaker NK of Iranian Armenian. Recordings were all transcribed with Praat with TextGrids. The Elicitations sheet ([`xlsx`](/Elicitations/Elicitations.xlsx) and [`tsv`](/Elicitations/Elicitations.tsv)) catalogs the elicitations. Recordings were done on different days. Items were broken up into individual .wav and TextGrid files via a Praat script (DiCanio 2020). 

In terms of recording quality, some of the elicitations were recorded by the consultant with Audacity on her laptop. She didn’t use an external microphone, but just the laptop’s internal microphone.  Some of the elicitations were recorded over Zoom as M4A files, then converted to WAV files. The consultant didn’t use an external microphone, but just the laptop’s internal microphone. Some items were recorded over Telegram or WhatsApp as voice messages. The Elicitations sheet details how each item was recorded. 

The Audacity-based recordings show the clearest acoustic cues for segments. The Zoom-based recordings significantly weakens word-initial prevoicing and word-initial uvular fricatives [χ,ʁ]. See Sanker et al 2021. 

## Text
The sample text is reported in the grammar. The text was taken from a public [Instagram video](https://www.instagram.com/tv/COWtIvUn4KA/). We tried to contact all the actors in the video to get consent. We heard back from 4 out of 6 participants and go their consent. The other two couldn't be tracked down. 

The folder contains the original [video](/SampleText/TextVideo.mp4), an extracted [audio file](/SampleText/TextAudio.wav), and a Praat [audio TextGrid](/SampleText/TextAudio.TextGrid). Glossing and transcriptions follow our grammar's conventions. 

## Grammar examples
The phonology chapter of our grammar displayed some wave forms. These examples were to show ejectives and to show intonation. This folder contains the original sound files and transcripts. 

The [Eastern recordings](/GrammarExamples/EasternAT) were done by a consultant AT over Facebook Messenger. The consultant recorded on her own phone on her mobile device. The quality of the recording shouldn’t be used for segmental features, but the intonational structure should be reliable. 

The [Iranian recordings](/GrammarExamples/IranianNK) were done by a consultant NK. The sentences were recorded by the consultant with Audacity on her laptop. She didn’t use an external microphone, but just the laptop’s internal microphone. The non-ejective word was recorded over Zoom, while the ejective word was recorded over Audacity. 

## Verb conjugations
The grammar went over all the conjugation classes that we could find. This folder provides the complete paradigms for these classes as a set of [`xlsx`](/VerbConjugation/XLSX) and [`tsv`](/VerbConjugation/TSV) files. The structure of these files are explained in the [README](/VerbConjugation/README.md). These paradigms are complete in the sense that, for a given class, we give the inflected form for all possible inflectional features. The grammar focused more on giving partial paradigms to improve readability.
